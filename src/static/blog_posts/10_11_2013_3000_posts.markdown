Preview: A commemorative post for the 3000th link scraped.

We've reached 3000 links! As a sort of commemorative thing, I figured I'd do
some analysis on the data we have. The <a href="http://i.imgur.com/Au4mfeL.jpg">3000th link itself</a>
is actually pretty appropriate, I think.

I've done quite a bit of work today to spruce things up, including a rather
small API. For instance, you can see the 3000th link <a
href="/data/2999/pretty">here</a> and get the data for it
<a href="/data/2999">here.</a> Keep in mind we index from 0
in this crazy world, so 2999 is actually the 3000th link.

In addition to this I've done some color tweaks on the site, because this whole
post-future-burned-neon theme that I've come up with isn't exactly conducive to
a blog, so I've unified a lot of the colors. I've also made the site a lot more
intra-linked, for instance the <a href="/top">top posters page</a> now links to
both the subdomains and users that it displays.

I figured the sigma graph was big enough and impressive enough to be it's own
page, so I moved that to <a href="/sigma">/sigma.</a> and collected everything
into one small page call <a href="/viz">/viz.</a> I'll keep it like this until I
start really hating it all, we'll see where it goes.

Anyway, on to the fun stats I promised.
